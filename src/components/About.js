        Hello! <br />
        <br /> I'm Claire, an events producer turned software engineer,
        passionate about solving complex problems through creating elegant and
        well-designed software. After studying neuroscience and film, I spent
        time producing live events in the entertainment and media industries.
        After a while, I found I wanted to work on something more tangiable and
        happened to try a coding course on Codeacademy, and was instantly
        hooked! I love building scalable and well-designed apps that are
        efficient under the hood, while also delivering seamless user
        experiences.{' '}
